# Optimizing Llama3.2 for CoreML
At WWDC 2024, Apple introduced solutions for converting LLMs to CoreML, alongside the iOS 18 update, which unlocked access to various APIs. Additionally, Meta announced Llama3.2, a new model optimized for On-Device environments, providing a strong foundation for implementing diverse ideas and streamlining On-Device development.

In line with these advancements, I have proposed a solution for converting Llama3.2 into CoreML by leveraging Appleâ€™s methods and making some modifications. As a practical demonstration, I also developed a simple app.
